# We are Tunnll
[Tunnll](http://tunnll.com) is a small startup company. We like to mix successful engineering management practices with marketing, administrative and design activities. In other words, we apply the best elements of [Kanban](https://youtu.be/CD0y-aU1sXo), [SCRUM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) and [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_development) both to software development and to all the non-engineering tasks. You can join us [here](/jobs/).

# How we work
[Our team](/jobs/) has a self-managed [horizontal structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization), which means that there are no team members who get paid for telling other people what to do. Instead, everyone actually does the job which is best suitable for that person and is most efficient for the current project.

# What we do
In some sence we are 'oldschool', because we do not [chase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) the latest trends in the IT and the startups world. Instead, we heavily invest in [projects](http://tunnll.com) that will be important even in 20 years from now. Thus, our projects have a strong relation to the physical world while aiming to generate significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_business">social impact</a>.
