### Compensation levels

The size of the proposed compensation may depend on your experience, demonstrated professional skills and your communication skills.

#### Growing the compensation rate as we work together

We are interested in investing in long-term relationships and that is why all compensations are subject to regular increases based on factors like gained experience, overall time spent in the company, number of new books read over the working period and number of the successfully completed online courses.
